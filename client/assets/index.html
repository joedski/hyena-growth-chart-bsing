				<p>The values presented here are still a work in progress pending feedback and research.</p>
				<p>The bars and left axis indicate the approximate body mass expected at a given age. The line and right axis indicate the linear growth, normalized to their expected maximum asymptotic growth; it is effectively to what percent their body has grown so far out of its total possible normal development.  The body mass is derived from the <em>un</em>normalized linear growth.</p>
				<p>Age as indicated here is in months since birth, not conception.  This is why the numbers don't start at 0.</p>
