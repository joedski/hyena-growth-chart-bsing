Totally BS Growth Chart for Fictional Characters
================================================

This originally started out as diddling around with the monomolecular growth chart found in [this article](http://jmammal.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/6/1298.figures-only) and a bit of algebra to backderive a bunch of factors after scribbling all over said chart.  It then turned into something else involving slapping piecewise sigmoids all over the place to patch together something resembling the growth process described to me.

But, it was still a good way to try out [nv.d3](https://github.com/novus/nvd3), so I guess there's that.  There's also a bunch of function composition happening, which shows how powerful such tools are when dealing with data.
